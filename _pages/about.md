Welcome to my website! I’m an economist and post-doctoral fellow at Paris-Saclay Applied Economics (PSAE) since November 2024. My research focuses on land use, with a particular emphasis on deforestation and biodiversity loss.  

My work employs econometric analysis, with a strong focus on causal inference techniques. I enjoy taking an interdisciplinary approach, integrating data from various fields to enrich economic perspectives. Feel free to explore my [scholar profile]([https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8PtkCrEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao]) for more on my research.
