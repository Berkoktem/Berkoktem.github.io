<strong> Welcome to my website! <strong> 

I’m an economist and postdoctoral fellow at Paris-Saclay Applied Economics (PSAE) since November 2024. My research focuses on land use, with a particular emphasis on deforestation and biodiversity loss.  

My work employs econometric analysis, with a strong focus on causal inference techniques. I enjoy taking an interdisciplinary approach, integrating data from various fields to enrich economic perspectives. Feel free to explore my [scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8PtkCrEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) for more on my research.
