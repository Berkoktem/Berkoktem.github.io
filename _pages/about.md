<strong>Welcome to my website!</strong>

I am an Assistant Professor in Economics at Université Paris-Saclay, affiliated with the RITM laboratory, since September 2025.

My research lies at the intersection of development, environmental, and agricultural economics. Using econometric analysis with a strong focus on causal inference, I take an interdisciplinary approach and combine data from different fields and sources. My recent work focuses on land use and climate change, with particular attention to deforestation and biodiversity loss.

Feel free to explore my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8PtkCrEAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) to learn more about my research.

Outside academia, I am passionate about running and enjoy discovering Paris one run at a time.
